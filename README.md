CarousellBot

CarousellBot allows you to automate the selling process in carousell without opening sg.carousell.com or the app. The bot periodically checks for your listing at a regular interval, and if your listing is not in the first page, it will automatically post the exact same listing. This can be done indefinately.

Installation:

1) You can clone this repository and compile it yourself
2) Go to releases and download the exported JAR file

Features:
1) Implemented the anti-captcha API to pull requests from the carousell server
2) Directly send login information/listing information in JSON to carousell servers without the need of a GUI browser or headless browser. Consequently this has made logging in/selling products extremely fast
3) All information is directly processed in JSON when requests are received and sent back to carousell servers in text format, allowing enhanced performance
